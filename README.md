# Poke-2

A Poke Go game created with React.

It randomly selects the data taken from 8 Pokes as Winner and Loser with the help of React and transfers the result to the web front.

Apart from React and JavaScript-HTML, different CSS features were also used in the project.

You can change the API data used in the game in the project and apply it to different projects.
